# BranchyNet-Replication
BranchyNet-Replication is a theoretical implementation that translates the core ideas of BranchyNet into a clean, modular code structure without focusing on training or performance. The project emphasizes early-exit branches, entropy-based decision making, and joint loss formulation to make the model’s inference logic explicit and easy to study.
